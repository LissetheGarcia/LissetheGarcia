## Hi there, I hope you to find my profile useful and interestingðŸ‘‹


I am a Computer Scientist with 3+ years of experience in high-performance computing (HPC), AI, and system validation.
Specialized in CPU and accelerator workloads with strong skills in performance tuning, application optimization, and
system-level validation. Experienced in using SIMD, multithreading, MPI, and OpenMP to enhance scalability, efficiency,
and runtime performance, primarily in C and C++. Experienced in:

1. Performance profiling and benchmarking using a wide variety of tools.
2. Selecting parallel-friendly algorithms and data structures for compute kernels.
3. Estimating and improving application speed-up and efficiency on multicore and heterogeneous systems.
   
Passionate about AI, deep learning. MCS thesis involved developing a deep convolutional neural network for mammography
density classification, in collaboration with the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Guadalajara (UAG), Centro MÃ©dico
Nacional de Occidente (CMNO), and the Jalisco State Government. Also explored NLP, fine-tuning LLMs, and deployed
GPU-accelerated models on small cloud clusters as side projects.

##  âš¡ Fun facts about me

Fun Fact 1: 
I love to read about anything, I consider myself a really curious person, who thinks some of the most wonderfult capacities of being human is the ability to learn and get impressed with all the knowledge that exists in this world. "We are all ignorant, but we are not all ignorant of the same things."

Fun Fact 2:
I really love cats, I love them in all their colors, and races.
