## Hi there, I hope you to find my profile useful and interestingðŸ‘‹


I am a Computer Scientist with 3+ years of experience in high-performance computing (HPC), AI, and system validation.
Specialized in CPU and accelerator workloads with strong skills in performance tuning, application optimization, and
system-level validation. Experienced in using SIMD, multithreading, MPI, and OpenMP to enhance scalability, efficiency,
and runtime performance, primarily in C and C++. Experienced in:

1. Performance profiling and benchmarking using a wide variety of tools.
2. Selecting parallel-friendly algorithms and data structures for compute kernels.
3. Estimating and improving application speed-up and efficiency on multicore and heterogeneous systems.
   
Passionate about AI, deep learning. MCS thesis involved developing a deep convolutional neural network for mammography
density classification, in collaboration with the Universidad AutÃ³noma de Guadalajara (UAG), Centro MÃ©dico
Nacional de Occidente (CMNO), and the Jalisco State Government. Also explored NLP, fine-tuning LLMs, and deployed
GPU-accelerated models on small cloud clusters as side projects.
